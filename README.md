# Train-Scheduler

This project is a basic form of a train scheduler which uses firebase as the real time database. You can simply enter four inputs which are train's attributes. Train name, Destination, First train time and Frequency. By clicking the submit button these information would be saved in the firebase database which is intialized in the javascript file. Train scheduler program calculates the next train arrival time and the minutes left to that time.

Just a web browser would be enough to run the game. I would recommend Google Chrome. You don't need to install anything extra.
 
### Running and test

Firebase database is initialized with some data. Therefore when you load the page you will see some train information on the display section. Enter a train informatin as it is asked in the form section and click submit. Your entry will be saved in the firebase database also you can see the next train arrival time and the minutes away to that time. Note that when you refresh the page you still can see your entry.
